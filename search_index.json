Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Kremling\nKremling is an npm library for writing CSS with React. It uses React hooks, is only 4kb gzipped,\nand requires no changes to your webpack config or build process.\nKremling Github page\nWalkthrough\nMotivation\nHere are the principles behind Kremling's CSS.\n\nScoped CSS. Have CSS rules apply to a component and its children, but no other components. Allow for cascading rules within a \"scope\".\nMake it easy to conditionally apply CSS. We can do better than ternaries for changing a dom element's CSS classes.\nRemove unused CSS from the DOM. When there are no more components that are using a CSS class, the  element for those components should be removed from the DOM.\nReadable class names. In your browser dev tools,  is easier to understand than .\n\nHooks example\nimport {useCss} from 'kremling'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const scope = useCss(css)\n\n  return (\n    \n      \n        A big button\n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nconst css = `\n/* your CSS classes are scoped for this component and its children components */\n& .container {\n  border: 1px solid lightgray;\n}\n\n& .big-button {\n  width: 40px;\n  height: 60px;\n}\n`\n\nClass component example\nimport {Scoped} from 'kremling'\n\nclass AnotherComponent extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n          \n            A big button\n          \n        \n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nconst css = `\n& .container {\n  border: 1px solid lightgray;\n}\n\n& .big-button {\n  width: 40px;\n  height: 60px;\n}\n`\n\nConditional CSS\nimport {always, maybe} from 'kremling'\n\nfunction ClickHere(props) {\n  return (\n     props.setWasClicked(true)}\n    >\n      Click here\n    \n  )\n}\n\nSeparate CSS file\n// foo.js\nimport {useCss} from 'bandicoot'\nimport css from './foo.css'\n\nfunction Foo(props) {\n  const scope = useCss(css)\n\n  return (\n    \n      Hello\n    \n  )\n}\n\n/* foo.css */\n.foo {\n  color: lawngreen;\n}\n\n"},"walkthrough/getting-started.html":{"url":"walkthrough/getting-started.html","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"Getting started with Kremling\nThis tutorial will help you write css for your React components with kremling.\nInstallation\nTo start, first install kremling.\nnpm install --save kremling # if you use npm\nyarn add kremling # if you use yarn\n\nWrite a component\nNow, write a component using kremling. To do so, we'll use the useCss hook from kremling\nand write some css as a javascript string.\nimport {useCss, always, maybe} from 'kremling'\n\nfunction MyComponent(props) {\n  const scope = useCss(css)\n\n  return (\n    \n      Hello world\n    \n  )\n}\n\nconst css = `\n& .container {\n  border: 1px solid black;\n}\n`\n\nThat's it! You can now render your component and the container div will have a 1px black border. There is no configuration\nto get kremling to work -- you don't need to eject or change your webpack configuration.\nDo I have to use hooks?\nNo, you can also use kremling's Scoped component to get similar functionality.\nWhat is useCss actually doing?\nIn the code above, we call useCss(css). But what is that actually doing?\nuseCss() is a React hook that you call with a css string.\nIt returns to you an object of props that you should apply to your container dom element.\nThis is called \"scoping the css\".\nWhat about that ampersand in the css string?\nYou might have noticed that in the code example that there is an ampersand (&) inside of our css string.\nThis is how you tell kremling that you're about to write a css rule. It is necessary because kremling uses it to make sure\nthat it is truly scoped and does not apply to any dom elements outside of our component and its children.\nYou can read more about how this works in the scoped css documentation.\nIf you don't like having to put in the &, you can pull out your css into a separate file and use the kremling-loader webpack loader to process\nyour css during your build. See the kremling-loader docs for more information.\nNext steps\nConditionally apply css\nuseCss docs\nUsage without hooks\n"},"walkthrough/conditional-css.html":{"url":"walkthrough/conditional-css.html","title":"Conditionally apply css","keywords":"","body":"Conditionally applying css\nSometimes we need to change which css we apply to a dom element, depending on the state of our application.\nFor example, we might have a loading css class that we only apply to a div when we're waiting for\nsome data.\nIn situations like that, kremling has some built in functions to make our code easy to write and to understand.\nExample\nimport {useCss, always, maybe} from 'kremling'\n\nfunction LoadingData(props) {\n  const scope = useCss(css)\n\n  // We want the 'loading' css class to only be on the div when we're loading data.\n  return (\n    \n      Your data.\n    \n  )\n}\n\nconst css = `\n& .data {\n  background-color: white;\n}\n\n& .loading {\n  background-color: lightgray;\n}\n`\n\nNow the background-color of our div will be white when there is data and light gray when we're waiting for data to load!\nHow this works\nCheck out the these docs for more detailed information\non how this works.\n"},"api/use-css.html":{"url":"api/use-css.html","title":"Using hooks","keywords":"","body":"useCss hook\nKremling exports a react hook called useCss, which you use in your components.\nTo do so, first make sure that your version of react is at least react@16.8.0.\nSince hooks only work with function components, you won't be able to call useCss in your class components.\nInstead, check out Scoped component, which is an alternative\nthat works great with classes.\nBasic Example\nThe useCss hook allows you to write css that will only apply to your component and to its children.\nimport React from 'react'\nimport {useCss} from 'kremling'\n\nfunction MyComponent(props) {\n  const scope = useCss(css)\n\n  return (\n    \n      \n        Button\n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nconst css = `\n& .container {\n  border: 1px solid black;\n}\n\n& .my-button {\n  background-color: lawngreen;\n}\n`\n\nIn this example, the container and my-button classes will work great for MyComponent, but cannot be\naccessed by any sibling or parent components. This is what kremling calls scoped css.\nOne thing to note is that we're able to use the my-button css class without putting the {...scope} props onto the\n. This is because you only need to be able to put {...scope} on your container elements, and the inner elements\nwill already be in scope. See the scoped css docs for more information.\nFragments\nWhen you return a fragment from a component, you'll often have two or more elements inside of the fragment. In such cases,\ndo not try to put the css scope onto the fragment, but instead on each of the elements inside of the fragment:\nimport React from 'react'\nimport {useCss} from 'kremling'\n\nfunction Mario() {\n  const scope = useCss(css)\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      \n        A div\n      \n      \n        A span\n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nconst css = `\n& .my-div {\n  border: 1px solid red;\n}\n\n& .my-span {\n  border: 1px solid blue;\n}\n`\n\nAdvanced Example\nSince css scopes apply to all dom elements in your component and in children components, you can define common css\nin a parent component that is used by all children.\nimport React from 'react'\nimport {useCss} from 'kremling'\n\nfunction Parent() {\n  return (\n    \n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nfunction Child() {\n  // The child-button class is \"in scope\"\n  return (\n    Child\n  )\n}\n\nconst css = `\n& .child-button {\n  background-color: blue;\n}\n`\n\nCan I apply a css scope to a React component (instead of a dom element)?\nNo you cannot. The props in the scope object need to be put into the dom. For example,\nthe following code will not work:\nimport React from 'react'\nimport {useCss} from 'kremling'\n\nfunction DontDoThis() {\n  const scope = useCss(css)\n\n  // Scope should only be applied to dom elements, not components\n  return (\n    \n  )\n}\n\nfunction Child(props) {\n  // The child-class css class will not be applied to this div.\n  return (\n    \n      Child\n    \n  )\n}\n\nconst css = `\n& .child-class {\n  color: lawngreen;\n}\n`\n\nAPI\nconst scope = useCss(css)\nThe useCss hook is called with one argument and returns an object.\nArguments\n\ncss: A string of css, or a PostCSS object created through kremling-loader. CSS\nstrings must have ampersand (&) characters before every css selector. The css will be appended to the dom when your\ncomponent is mounted, and will be removed from the dom when the component unmounts. Changing the css that is passed\ninto useCss() is a supported feature - a new css scope will be created for the new css.\n\nReturn value\nuseCss returns an object of React props that you should apply to dom element containers. The container and any elements inside\nof the container will be \"in scope\" and have access to your css rules.\n"},"api/scoped-component.html":{"url":"api/scoped-component.html","title":"Class components","keywords":"","body":"Scoped component\nKremling exports a component called Scoped that can be used in your class or function components.\nThe Scoped component appends your css to the dom and modifies its direct children so that they\nare containers for the css scope.\nIf you are using function components and/or hooks, it is recommended that you use useCss\ninstead of the Scoped component. However, feel free to use the Scoped component however you would like to - it\nis a fully supported feature of kremling that is part of kremling's long term future.\nExample\nTo use the Scoped component, you should import it from kremling and render it around whichever\ndom elements you want your css to apply to:\nimport React from 'react'\nimport {Scoped} from 'kremling'\n\nclass ShoppingCart extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n          \n            My button\n          \n        \n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nconst css = `\n& .container {\n  border: 1px solid black;\n}\n\n& .my-button {\n  background-color: brown;\n}\n`\n\nAdvanced example\nScoped css is applicable to all dom elements inside of the Scoped component. This means that css rules defined in parent components\nare available in children components. This can be desireable sometimes, and a double edged sword if it's unexpected. Here is how\nto use it to your advantage:\nimport React from 'react'\nimport {Scoped} from 'kremling'\n\nclass Parent extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n          \n        \n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nconst css = `\n& .child-button {\n  background-color: orange;\n}\n`\n\nclass Child extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    // Child can use the child-button class because it is \"in the css scope.\"\n    return (\n      \n        Child button\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nGotchas\nThe Scoped component modifies its direct children by adding dom attributes to them. Because of this, only direct children of Scoped\nthat are dom elements will actually be part of the css scope.\nIt is easy to forget this and can be difficult to debug. If you find yourself getting frustrated with this gotcha, try out the\nuseCss hook, whose syntax is more explicit in showing which dom elements are in the CSS scope.\nimport React from 'react'\nimport {Scoped} from 'kremling'\n\nclass Parent extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    // Since Child is a direct child of Scoped and is not a dom element, the \"gotcha\" applies.\n    // This means that Child will not be able to use the css classes defined in Parent.\n    return (\n      \n        \n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nconst css = `\n& .child-span {\n  border: 1px solid black;\n}\n`\n\nclass Child extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    // The child-span css class won't be \"in scope\" and won't work.\n    return (\n      \n        Child span\n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nAPI\nProps\n\ncss: A css string that has ampersands (&) in it before each css selector. The rules in this css string will\napply to dom elements that are children of the Scoped component.\npostcss: A PostCSS object created by kremling-loader.\nchildren: The direct children provided to Scoped will be modified to have extra dom attributes to do the\ncss scoping. Direct children to Scoped should usually be dom elements, not React components.\nSee the Gotcha section above.\nnamespace: A string that overrides the name of the dom attribute that kremling adds to your dom elements.\nSee these docs for more info.\n\nStatic properties\nYou can configure the dom attributes created by Scoped by changing Scoped.defaultNamespace. See these docs for\nmore information.\n"},"walkthrough/kremling-loader.html":{"url":"walkthrough/kremling-loader.html","title":"Kremling loader","keywords":"","body":"Kremling loader\nIf you'd like to preprocess your css with PostCSS (for autoprefixer or anything else),\nyou'll need to add kremling-loader to your\nwepback config.

Many css-in-js libs for React\nwill encourage you to name css classes with camel case so that they are easier to use in javascript. However, with\nkremling it truly doesn't matter since you will never need to reference your css classes with javascript variables.\nSoft recommendation: Use hyphens, since that's the de facto standard in html and css.\nStart with very simple names\nWith kremling, you don't have to worry about your css leaking out of its scope, which means you can\nname your css class something generic like .button {} and not have to worry about it colliding with\ndom elements in a completely different area of your app.\n/* easy for humans to understand, so start by naming things like this */\n.big-button {}\n\n/* might avoid some naming collisions, but only change to it if you need to */\n.big-button-for-modal {}\n\nAmpersands (&)\nIf you are using kremling-loader, you'll never have to insert ampersands into your css.\nIf you are not, you will have to add ampersands before every css rule.\nExamples\n/* if you're not using kremling-loader */\n\n/* put an ampersand before your class name */\n& .foo {}\n\n/* put an ampersand before any other type of css rule */\n& div {}\n\n/* put an ampersand before each rule in a list of rules */\n& .bar, & .baz, & .bing {}\n\n"},"concepts/scoped-css.html":{"url":"concepts/scoped-css.html","title":"Scoped css","keywords":"","body":"Scoped css\nIn Kremling, scoped css refers to css rules that only apply to a dom element container and all of its dom element children.\nThis is different from global css, where css classes can be used by any code in any place.\nScoped css is also different from local css, where css rules that only apply to the dom elements in a particular react component.\nWhy scoped css?\nScoped css let's us not have to worry about global css class collision while also allowing us to inherit css from parent components\nto child components if we want to.

Instead, more and more\ncss is appended to the dom as you load code and mount components.\nOne distinctive feature of Kremling is that it will only append your css to the DOM when necessary.\nThis means that before your components are mounted, there will not be any  elements\nappended to the DOM.\nAdditionally, kremling will remove  elements from the DOM as soon as there are no more components\nusing a css string. This is beneficial for overall DOM performance, since the browser will not have to deal\nwith a continuously growing set of css rules that do not apply to anything currently in the dom.\n"}}}

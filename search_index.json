Introduction","keywords":"","body":"Kremling\nKremling is an npm library for writing CSS with React. It uses React hooks, is only 4kb gzipped,\nand requires no changes to your webpack config or build process.\nKremling Github page\nWalkthrough\nMotivation\nHere are the principles behind Kremling's CSS.\n\nScoped CSS. Have CSS rules apply to a component and its children, but no other components. Allow for cascading rules within a \"scope\".\nMake it easy to conditionally apply CSS. We can do better than ternaries for changing a dom element's CSS classes.\nRemove unused CSS from the DOM. When there are no more components that are using a CSS class, the  element for those components should be removed from the DOM.\nReadable class names. In your browser dev tools,  is easier to understand than .\n\nHooks example\nimport {useCss} from 'kremling'\n\nfunction MyComponent() {\n  const scope = useCss(css)\n\n  return (\n    \n      \n        A big button\n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nconst css = `\n/* your CSS classes are scoped for this component and its children components */\n& .container {\n  border: 1px solid lightgray;\n}\n\n& .big-button {\n  width: 40px;\n  height: 60px;\n}\n`\n\nClass component example\nimport {Scoped} from 'kremling'\n\nclass AnotherComponent extends React.Component {\n  render() {\n    return (\n      \n        \n          \n            A big button\n          \n        \n      \n    )\n  }\n}\n\nconst css = `\n& .container {\n  border: 1px solid lightgray;\n}\n\n& .big-button {\n  width: 40px;\n  height: 60px;\n}\n`\n\nConditional CSS\nimport {always, maybe} from 'kremling'\n\nfunction ClickHere(props) {\n  return (\n     props.setWasClicked(true)}\n    >\n      Click here\n    \n  )\n}\n\nSeparate CSS file\n// foo.js\nimport {useCss} from 'bandicoot'\nimport css from './foo.css'\n\nfunction Foo(props) {\n  const scope = useCss(css)\n\n  return (\n    \n      Hello\n    \n  )\n}\n\n/* foo.css */\n.foo {\n  color: lawngreen;\n}\n\n"},"walkthrough/getting-started.html":{"url":"walkthrough/getting-started.html","title":"Getting Started","keywords":"","body":"Getting started with Kremling\nThis tutorial will help you write css for your React components with kremling.\nInstallation\nTo start, first install kremling.\nnpm install --save kremling # if you use npm\nyarn add kremling # if you use yarn\n\nWrite a component\nNow, write a component using kremling. To do so, we'll use the useCss hook from kremling\nand write some css as a javascript string.\nimport {useCss, always, maybe} from 'kremling'\n\nfunction MyComponent(props) {\n  const scope = useCss(css)\n\n  return (\n    \n      Hello world\n    \n  )\n}\n\nconst css = `\n& .container {\n  border: 1px solid black;\n}\n`\n\nThat's it! You can now render your component and the container div will have a 1px black border. There is no configuration\nto get kremling to work -- you don't need to eject or change your webpack configuration.\nDo I have to use hooks?\nNo, you can also use kremling's Scoped component to get similar functionality.\nWhat is useCss actually doing?\nIn the code above, we call useCss(css). But what is that actually doing?\nuseCss() is a React hook that you call with a css string.\nIt returns to you an object of props that you should apply to your container dom element.\nThis is called \"scoping the css\".\nWhat about that ampersand in the css string?\nYou might have noticed that in the code example that there is an ampersand (&) inside of our css string.\nThis is how you tell kremling that you're about to write a css rule. It is necessary because kremling uses it to make sure\nthat it is truly scoped and does not apply to any dom elements outside of our component and its children.\nYou can read more about how this works in the scoped css documentation.\nIf you don't like having to put in the &, you can pull out your css into a separate file and use the kremling-loader webpack loader to process\nyour css during your build. See the kremling-loader docs for more information.\nNext steps\nConditionally apply css\nuseCss docs\nUsage without hooks\n"},"walkthrough/conditional-css.html":{"url":"walkthrough/conditional-css.html","title":"Conditionally apply css","keywords":"","body":"Conditionally applying css\nSometimes we need to change which css we apply to a dom element, depending on the state of our application.\nFor example, we might have a loading css class that we only apply to a div when we're waiting for\nsome data.\nIn situations like that, kremling has some built in functions to make our code easy to write and to understand.\nExample\nimport {useCss, always, maybe} from 'kremling'\n\nfunction LoadingData(props) {\n  const scope = useCss(css)\n\n  // We want the 'loading' css class to only be on the div when we're loading data.\n  return (\n    \n      Your data.\n    \n  )\n}\n\nconst css = `\n& .data {\n  background-color: white;\n}\n\n& .loading {\n  background-color: lightgray;\n}\n`\n\nNow the background-color of our div will be white when there is data and light gray when we're waiting for data to load!\nHow this works\nCheck out the these docs for more detailed information\non how this works.\n"},"api/use-css.html":{"url":"api/use-css.html","title":"Using hooks","keywords":"","body":"useCss hook\nKremling exports a react hook called useCss, which you use in your components.\nTo do so, first make sure that your version of react is at least react@16.8.0.\nSince hooks only work with function components, you won't be able to call useCss in your class components.\nInstead, check out Scoped component, which is an alternative\nthat works great with classes.\nBasic Example\nThe useCss hook allows you to write css that will only apply to your component and to its children.\nimport React from 'react'\nimport {useCss} from 'kremling'\n\nfunction MyComponent(props) {\n  const scope = useCss(css)\n\n  return (\n    \n      \n        Button\n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nconst css = `\n& .container {\n  border: 1px solid black;\n}\n\n& .my-button {\n  background-color: lawngreen;\n}\n`\n\nIn this example, the container and my-button classes will work great for MyComponent, but cannot be\naccessed by any sibling or parent components. This is what kremling calls scoped css.\nOne thing to note is that we're able to use the my-button css class without putting the {...scope} props onto the\n. This is because you only need to be able to put {...scope} on your container elements, and the inner elements\nwill already be in scope. See the scoped css docs for more information.\nFragments\nWhen you return a fragment from a component, you'll often have two or more elements inside of the fragment. In such cases,\ndo not try to put the css scope onto the fragment, but instead on each of the elements inside of the fragment:\nimport React from 'react'\nimport {useCss} from 'kremling'\n\nfunction Mario() {\n  const scope = useCss(css)\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      \n        A div\n      \n      \n        A span\n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nconst css = `\n& .my-div {\n  border: 1px solid red;\n}\n\n& .my-span {\n  border: 1px solid blue;\n}\n`\n\nAdvanced Example\nSince css scopes apply to all dom elements in your component and in children components, you can define common css\nin a parent component that is used by all children.\nimport React from 'react'\nimport {useCss} from 'kremling'\n\nfunction Parent() {\n  return (\n    \n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nfunction Child() {\n  // The child-button class is \"in scope\"\n  return (\n    Child\n  )\n}\n\nconst css = `\n& .child-button {\n  background-color: blue;\n}\n`\n\nCan I apply a css scope to a React component (instead of a dom element)?\nNo you cannot. The props in the scope object need to be put into the dom. For example,\nthe following code will not work:\nimport React from 'react'\nimport {useCss} from 'kremling'\n\nfunction DontDoThis() {\n  const scope = useCss(css)\n\n  // Scope should only be applied to dom elements, not components\n  return (\n    \n  )\n}\n\nfunction Child(props) {\n  // The child-class css class will not be defined in the dom.\n  return (\n    \n      Child\n    \n  )\n}\n\nconst css = `\n& .child-class {\n  color: lawngreen;\n}\n`\n\nAPI\nconst scope = useCss(css)\nThe useCss hook is called with one argument and returns an object.\nArguments\n\ncss: A string of css, or a PostCSS object created through kremling-loader.\n\n\n\n"},"api/scoped-component.html":{"url":"api/scoped-component.html","title":"Class components","keywords":"","body":"Scoped component\n"},"walkthrough/kremling-loader.html":{"url":"walkthrough/kremling-loader.html","title":"Kremling loader","keywords":"","body":"Kremling loader\nIf you'd like to preprocess your css with PostCSS (for autoprefixer or anything else),\nyou'll need to add kremling-loader to your\nwepback config. To do so, follow the kremling-loader instructions.\nExample\nOnce you've set up kremling-loader, here is how you can write components with kremling css:\nyoshi.js\nimport React from 'react'\nimport css from './yoshi.css'\n\nfunction Yoshi(props) {\n  const scope = useCss(css)\n\n  return (\n    \n      \n        Yoshi is a fictional dinosaur who, although intelligent,\n        is enslaved by a human plumber named Mario.\n      \n    \n  )\n}\n\nyoshi.css\n.container {\n  padding: 16px;\n  border: 1px solid black;\n}\n\n.yoshi-description {\n  color: green;\n}\n\nAdvantages\nUsing kremling-loader allows you to omit the & in your css rules, since the css will be processed at build time instead of in the browser.\nAdditionally, since kremling-loader requires your css to be in a different file than your javascript code, you'll get nicer syntax highlighting in\nyour IDE.\nDisavantages\nIf you're using create react app, you'll have to eject your webpack configuration in order to add kremling-loader to it.\nAdditionally, you'll have to create a separate css file for each of your react components, instead of having everything the entire component encapsulated in one file.\n"},"walkthrough/configuration.html":{"url":"walkthrough/configuration.html","title":"Configuration","keywords":"","body":"Configuration\nBy default, kremling requires zero configuration.

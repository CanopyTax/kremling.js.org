# Configuration
By default, kremling requires zero configuration. There is no need to change or eject your webpack config. And no need to configure anything inside of your source code.

## Webpack
You don't need to change your webpack config to use kremling, but you can if you'd like to use [kremling-loader](kremling-loader.md).

## Kremling attributes in DOM
If you'd like to change the kremling attributes in the dom (such as in `<div kremling="0">`), you can do so by changing the [kremling namespace](/concepts/namespace.md).
